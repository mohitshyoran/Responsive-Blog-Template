            One of the big ideas he focuses on in his book is about the power of discipline.
            Discipline is defined as being about to train or develop by instruction and exercise, especially in
            self-control.
            It is easy to come home from a long day of work and to put your feet up on the couch to watch some Netflix.
            It is also becoming increasingly easy in any major city to order fast food right to your door. Moving little
            and consuming unhealthy foods has never been so easy since the existence of humans.
            But where does discipline fall in these and other daily decisions that we can make?
            Having discipline in all areas of life can mold you into an incredibly high functioning individual.
            Discipline is being aware of the easiest, less resistive decisions we can make and taking the willful action
            of choosing an alternative route. — Ryan Fahey
            For example, if I know I should do a 30-minute workout after my workday yet come home and fall asleep on the
            couch only to wake a few hours later to consume food that is unhealthy for me, I am exhibiting a very low
            discipline for taking care of my mind and body.
            However, if I come home from work truly exhausted, set a timer for a 20-minute power nap, wake up after 20
            minutes to do a 30-minute workout before cooking a healthy meal with natural ingredients, I am exhibiting a
            good level of discipline in taking care of my mind and body.
            When decisions like the latter become a daily habit, you begin to create a life filled with a high level of
            discipline.
            Charles Duhigg who wrote “The Power Of Habit”, refers to humans as being a series of habits. Really our
            physical lives are an extension of our daily habits. He also talks about what he calls, ‘Keystone Habits’
            which are habits that unlock the key to your great potential each day.
            I love keystone habits.
            A keystone habit for me is running. If I run 30 minutes a day it changes ALL other habits within my day.
            This requires discipline for me on the days where I just don’t feel like running and choosing the path of
            least resistance instead.
            Here are the top 10 benefits I get from the keystone habit of daily (disciplined) running.
            I eat better
            Feel emotionally regulated at work
            Think more clearly about my goals
            Focus more on effective tasks instead of unimportant tasks
            Higher Productivity
            Greater mental stamina
            Feel internal peace
            Write more clearly
            Become inspired by the world around me
            Project higher confidence
            Discipline, when applied daily, can yield tremendous results.
            I want you to think about the 10 things above I just highlighted. Would you not want any of them present in
            your life?
            My encouragement for you today is this. The next time you feel like sitting on the couch and watching hours
            and hours of all-consuming Netflix content, think about discipline in that area of your life. Try to shorten
            that act into 2–3 days per week down from 5–6. If you eat fast food often, try shrinking that down to 1–2
            days per week for the first few weeks.
            If you can make small changes now you can allow discipline the opportunity to enter into your life day after
            day. Over time, your life will then move from good to great.
